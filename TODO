=== glibc ===
- Fix prefix to /usr but set a DESTDIR on install
    - (see LFS docs https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter05/glibc.html)
    - This allows for having glibc not be broken, but with a risk.
      If the DESTDIR gets messed up in any way, the user's system is hosed.

=== Linux Config ===
- Remove 802.11 stuff
- Remove touchscreen stuff
- Remove GPU (DRM) stuff
